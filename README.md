#Supervised Machine Learning Practice Repository

Welcome to my Supervised Machine Learning repository!

This project is a collection of all the files, notebooks, and scripts I created while learning and practicing supervised machine learning. It reflects my personal journey â€” from understanding fundamental concepts to implementing models and evaluating their performance on real-world datasets.

#Topics Covered

Linear Regression (Simple and Multiple)

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees 

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naive Bayes Classifier

model-selection

Performance evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score etc)

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

#Why I Built This

I created this repository as part of my machine learning self-study journey. It helped me reinforce theoretical knowledge by applying it practically. It also serves as a portfolio to demonstrate my learning progress and a reference for future projects.

#Tools and Technologies Used

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas and NumPy

Matplotlib and Seaborn
